# park-and-recreation-finder

The Park and Recreation Finder application is a configuration of ArcGIS for Server and a JavaScript application
that allows citizens to locate park and recreation opportunities in their community. This application is typically
used by citizens to locate a park in their community that offers a recreation activity they are interested in, but
can also be used by visitors to locate a park in a community they are visiting.
